<h2 class="section__heading center-text">The Issue With Enterprise Training</h2>

	<p style="text-align:center;">For decades we’ve worked with large enterprises on their transformation initiatives. Training has proven foundational to each of them. It’s unrealistic to ask people to work in a radically new way without clearly explaining how work will get done. However, with large enterprises we consistently run into the same 3 issues. </p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Issue 1: Scalability</p>
		<p>Seldom are there enough trainers or classes to keep pace with demand. Put simply, instructor-led training doesn’t scale.</p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Issue 2. Flexibility</p>
		<p>Instructor-led training forces workers to either neglect role responsibilities or opt out of training. Neither option serves the enterprise well. </p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Issue 3. Efficacy</p>
		<p>The time between learning a new concept and its application is critical. With traditional training, this lag time can amount to weeks or months.</p>
