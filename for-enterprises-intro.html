<h2 class="section__heading center-text">The Problem With Enterprise Training</h2>

	<p style="text-align:center;">For decades we’ve worked with large enterprises on their transformation initiatives. Training has proven foundational to each of them. It’s unrealistic to ask people to work in a radically new way without clearly explaining how work will get done. However, with large enterprises we consistently run into the same 3 problems. </p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Problem 1: Scalability</p>
		<p>The traditional approach with instructor-led training is not designed for the speed or scale needed. Seldom are there enough trainers or classes to keep pace with demand. Put simply, instructor-led training doesn’t scale.</p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Problem 2. Flexibility</p>
		<p>With ever escalating demands on employees, few enterprises can afford to sideline their workers for a two-day training session. Instructor-led training forces a bargain. Either neglect role responsibilities or opt out of training. Neither option serves the enterprise well. </p>

		<p class="section__subheading">Problem 3. Efficacy</p>
		<p>The human brain is quite adept at shelving any information it doesn’t deem immediately relevant. The time between learning a new concept and its application is critical. In a traditional training model, this lag time can amount to weeks or months.</p>
